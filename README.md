# Weather-Prediction-App'

This is a Weather prediction application, developed using Python ((PyTorch, SkitLearn, Matplotlib,StreamLit, Pandas, Tensorflow) and PostgreSQl. Here we had a set of 30K+ of rows of data which were processed and then given to model to learn. Model has two version, one being based on Neural Network and the other being Random Forest algorithm, for comparison purposes. All results, absolute errors, accuracy were displayed on a simple web app for users to see the quality of both types of models and see the results of the forecast for the next 7 days.
